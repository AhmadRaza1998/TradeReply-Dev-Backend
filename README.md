## üìò Purpose

- Provide a structured development workflow for building and testing features.
- Allow developers to stage and review changes locally before deploying to the development server.
- Facilitate modular deployment by restructuring the repository into **frontend** and **backend** directories.

---

## üöÄ Tech Stack
- **Quick Overview**: SPA, SSR with Inertia.js + React + Laravel + MySQL + TailwindCSS + AWS
- **Frontend**: React with JSX and SCSS for building interactive user interfaces, styled with TailwindCSS and Sass for maintainable, modular CSS. Vite is used for hot module replacement (HMR) and fast asset bundling.
- **Backend**: Laravel for robust API development and server-side logic, integrated with the `laravel-vite-plugin` for seamless asset management.
- **Database**: MySQL for relational data management.
- **Build Tools**: Vite serves as the primary build tool, replacing Laravel Mix, with scripts for development (`npm run dev`), production builds (`npm run build`), and formatting (`npm run format`) powered by Prettier. ESLint ensures consistent code quality.
- **UI Libraries**: Bootstrap and React-Bootstrap for prebuilt components, with additional enhancements from React-Select, React-Datepicker, and React-Slick for advanced UI functionality.
- **Hosting**: AWS (EC2 T3 small (64-bit x86) using Apache Web Server on Ubuntu Server for compute, RDS for database, S3 for storage).
- **Validation**: Yup for schema-based form validation, often paired with React forms for robust input handling.
- **HTTP Requests**: Axios is used for API interactions, simplifying HTTP request management and error handling.

## üñÇÔ∏è Repository Restructuring Instructions

To align with deployment requirements, the repository must be restructured as follows:

- **Frontend**:
  - Contains all JSX, SCSS, images, fonts, and other frontend-specific files.
  - JavaScript files (`.js` and `.jsx`) related to React and other client-side functionality are stored here.
  - The `vite.config.js` file resides in the `frontend/` directory, as it manages Vite‚Äôs configuration for bundling frontend assets.
  - Built assets from Vite will be output to the `backend/public/` directory.

- **Backend**:
  - Includes all Laravel framework files, such as `app/`, `config/`, `routes/`, and `resources/` for backend logic and views.
  - Resources for views will contain `app.blade.php` in `backend/resources/views/`.
  - Any backend-specific JavaScript files required for server-side logic or direct Laravel use (e.g., API utilities) are stored in the backend and are not built by Vite.

### Steps for Restructuring

1. Create two top-level directories: `frontend/` and `backend/`.
2. Move:
   - JSX, SCSS, images, fonts, and other frontend-specific files to `frontend/`.
   - Laravel framework files, including `app/`, `config/`, `routes/`, and `resources/`, to `backend/`.
   - Place `vite.config.js` in the `frontend/` directory to manage Vite builds.
   - Ensure the `backend/public/` directory remains the output target for Vite builds.
3. Set up separate `.env` files for both `frontend/` and `backend/`:
   - The `frontend/` directory should handle Vite and frontend-related configurations.
   - The `backend/` directory should handle Laravel and server-side configurations.
4. Adjust Laravel‚Äôs `app.blade.php`:
   - Ensure it includes the `@vite` directive for frontend assets.
5. Verify imports and paths:
   - Check all frontend imports (e.g., images, fonts, and SCSS) to ensure compatibility after restructuring.
   - Ensure backend-specific scripts and assets are correctly referenced and not dependent on Vite builds.
   - Verify paths in all files reference correct locations after build.
6. Test the restructured setup:
   - Run `npm run dev` for the frontend and `php artisan serve` for the backend to ensure both parts work as expected.
